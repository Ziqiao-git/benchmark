Many \u2018some constant\u2019 placeholders remain. Accuracy is therefore partial and requirements are unmet.\n\nModel A\u2019s response to Model B\u2019s Kerr\u2013AdS question, by contrast, delivers the requested outline: it writes the Teukolsky equation, sets up the double expansion, performs a first-order WKB/Bohr-Sommerfeld shift to obtain Re \u03c9, shows how Im \u03c9 equals half the Lyapunov exponent, explains AdS boundary conditions, and tracks the onset of superradiant instability with explicit criteria.

The steps, equations and scaling assumptions align with what the question asked; although still schematic it furnishes the requested systematic procedure and key formulas.\n\nModel B\u2019s answer to Model A, while informative, is explicitly labelled \u201cschematic\u201d and omits many derivational details the prompt insisted on (\u201cprovide complete derivations for parts 1\u20134\u201d).
